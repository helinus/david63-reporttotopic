For one, it ensures that users who do not have permission to view reports from a certain forum in the MCP also cannot view reports from that forum in the reports forum, as permissions can be set on the forums. Secondly, it also helps with organization so that the reports forum doesn't get overly cluttered.\r\n* Fully customizable report information. An admin can define which information is shown in the report topic by creating a template through the ACP, with the use of tokens the admin can add/remove certain information.\r\n\r\n## Languages:\r\nen\r\n\r\n## Status:\r\n0.1.1-beta\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\n* Download the latest release and unpack it.\r\n* Copy the entire contents from the unzipped folder to `root/ext/`\r\n* Navigate in the ACP to **Customise** -> **Manage extensions**.\r\n* Find **Report to topic** under \"Disabled Extensions\" and click **Enable**.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## NOTE:\r\nThis extension will require a new event adding to the core and will not work without out it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
